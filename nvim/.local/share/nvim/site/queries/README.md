# Treesitter queries

## Text objects

The `textobjects.scm` query files have been copied from [nvim-treesitter-textobjects](https://github.com/nvim-treesitter/nvim-treesitter-textobjects/tree/0f051e9813a36481f48ca1f833897210dbcfffde/queries).

These files have been slightly altered to remove non-standard TreeSitter expressions which are not supported by `mini.ai` (e.g. `make-range`).
